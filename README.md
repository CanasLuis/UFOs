# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis
we have been given with a data base of UFOs seen in different cities, the purpose of this activity is to use JS and HTML tools to make a webpage with dinamic filters that can show us the information we request, i.e. year, city, country, type of signal shown.

## How to perform a search
As mentioned above, the tool we built let us make searches using different types of information like the date, city, state, country and shape, we can choose any specific data for each one of them or just put a city or a year, and the tool will show us all the information available about it. 

after weÂ´ve set the search we want to make, we have to click on "Filter Table" button.

#Summary
This tool can be implemented for almost any similar kind of information we have, and we can make a very useful tool that can show us the right type of information we are looking for. In addition to that, there can be also a develpment tool that can clear the page if we want to make another search. Furthermore, I would add an additional filter to search for more statistical or descriptive information, i.e. the latest UFO seen, the one with the longest duration, the city/country with more records, etc. 

The important thing to remember is that this tools are always able to be improved, nothing is perfect and it will depends on the user and its needs, but we can always make them better and easier to use with small changes in our js files.
